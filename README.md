# Certificate Generator System

An automated system for generating personalized certificates quickly, efficiently, and at scale — ideal for events, workshops, courses, and more.

## 📌 Overview

The Certificate Generator System streamlines the creation of professional certificates by automating the process of inserting names and event details into a pre-designed certificate template. Whether you're handling a handful of attendees or hundreds, this tool ensures consistency and saves hours of manual work.

- 🔁 **Batch Processing** – Supports bulk certificate generation via CSV or list input.
- 🌐 **Web Interface** – (Optional) Simple UI for entering details or uploading lists.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload or Select a Certificate Template** – A blank certificate image or PDF.
2. **Input Recipient Details** – Manually or via CSV file (for batch processing).
3. **Auto-generate Certificates** – The system inserts names and other details into specific positions.
4. **Download Certificates** – Save as individual PDFs or a ZIP of all.
